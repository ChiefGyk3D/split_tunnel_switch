# NetworkManager Split Tunnel Configuration
# Copy this file to /etc/split_tunnel/split_tunnel.conf and customize

# Define the subnets that should bypass the VPN
# These subnets will be routed through your regular gateway instead of the VPN
# Format: BYPASS_SUBNETS=("subnet1" "subnet2" "subnet3")
# Examples:
#   - Local network: "192.168.1.0/24"
#   - Private network range: "10.0.0.0/8"
#   - Specific device: "192.168.1.100/32"
BYPASS_SUBNETS=("192.168.1.0/24" "192.168.2.0/24")

# VPN interface to exclude from routing
# This is typically the interface created by your VPN client
# Common values:
#   - OpenVPN: "tun0" or "tap0"
#   - WireGuard: "wg0"
#   - IPsec: "ipsec0"
VPN_INTERFACE="tun0"

# Enable logging to /var/log/split_tunnel.log
# Set to "true" to enable logging, "false" to disable
# Logs include route additions, removals, and any errors
ENABLE_LOGGING="true"

# Dry run mode (for testing without making changes)
# When set to "true", the script will show what it would do without actually
# modifying any routes. Useful for testing configuration.
# Set to "false" for normal operation
DRY_RUN="false"

# Additional custom settings can be added below
# These variables will be available in the split_tunnel.sh script

# Example: Custom log file location
# LOG_FILE="/var/log/my_custom_split_tunnel.log"

# Example: Custom lock file location
# LOCK_FILE="/var/run/my_split_tunnel.lock"
